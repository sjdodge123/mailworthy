# Decision algorithm research (2026-10-20)

Goal (operator): **the most gold while leveling, with the player doing no math.**
Every factor below has to work with the defaults and no new setting the player must
understand. This doc covers two things: whether the current beta build needs an
addon update (no), and what should change in the mail / vendor / bank decision, ranked
by impact for Mailworthy.

## 1. Beta build check: no update needed

| Fact | Finding |
|---|---|
| Latest beta client | 1.60.1.**70450** (Oct 16); 70425 (Oct 15) carried the last real changes |
| Interface number | still **16001** (set in 70170 on Oct 1; the client version string has not moved off 1.60.1) |
| Beta ends | Oct 21 Pacific (stress test takes over, beta reopens after) |
| Launch | **Nov 4, 2026, 3 PM PST** (epoch `1793833200`); first raids Dec 9 (= launch day 35) |
| Addon-facing changes Oct 1 to 16 | none listed: no mail, bag, container, auction API or SavedVariables changes; `WOW_PROJECT_CAMELOT` constant added Oct 1; gamepad bindings made static Oct 1 |
| Game-data changes that touch our numbers | Oct 15: "many profession-created items have reduced vendor sell prices" (we read live vendor prices, nothing to change); Oct 15: AH gained an equip-level column |
| Mail globals we call | `GetSendMailPrice`, `GetInboxInvoiceInfo`, `GetSendMailItem`, `ClickSendMailItemButton`, `SetSendMailMoney`, `SetSendMailCOD`, `GetInboxHeaderInfo` all still used by `Blizzard_MailFrame/MailFrame.lua` on the `forever` branch |
| Removed globals reported by addon authors | `GetItemInfo`, `GetSpellInfo`, `math.randomseed`, ... reported nil on some builds. `Prices.lua` already prefers `C_Item.GetItemInfo` / `C_Item.GetItemInfoInstant` with the global as fallback; nothing else we call is on that list |
| Source mirrors | Ketho's `wow-ui-source-forever` stopped at 70009 (Sep 24); Bleakfiber's snapshot is 70205 (Oct 3). **No source for 70425 / 70450 exists**, so the API check above rests on the patch notes plus the mail frame at 70009 |

What to do before launch: nothing in code. Run `/mw report` once on the stress-test
build (Oct 21) and once on launch day; confirm Auctionator's Forever file still exposes
`API.v1` (340/341 did). If anything is blocked, that is the first PR.

## 2. What players actually use to decide AH vs vendor

Sources: Classic forum threads, Wowpedia "Working the Auction House", TSM / Lazy
Goldmaker price-source guides, the Forever beta AH guide (warcraftforever.games), and
three keep-or-sell addons updated this month (KeepOrSell, AuctionHouse Forever,
MuleMate / AuctionWorthy from PLAN "Related addons"). Nobody publishes week-by-week
price curves for fresh realms (NexusHub's API is gone; TSM has no region data on
Forever), so the time-based findings below are the consistent community account, not
measured data. Mailworthy should **measure them itself** (section 4).

| # | Factor | How players use it | Mailworthy today |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Net vs vendor after fees** | 5% faction cut (15% neutral), deposit lost if it expires, "if the deposit is more than it sells for, vendor it". Rules of thumb: MuleMate 110% of vendor, KeepOrSell 2x vendor, Wowpedia "vendor after it expires twice" | done: `ahNet = price x n x 0.95 - deposit - postage`, mail at >= 5s and 25% |
| 2 | **Is the price real?** | min buyout is "usually lower than market value and misleading when unusually low" (one 1c undercut); goblins use a market value / median, never the single lowest listing; AHF uses "the middle of the cheapest listings" | **not done**: we use Auctionator's single last-scan minimum |
| 3 | **Will it sell before it expires?** (liquidity) | TSM sale rate / sold-per-day; "avoid items where very few sell a day"; raw materials move constantly, crafted goods and low greens don't | **not done**: deposit counted as lost (relist factor 1.0) stands in for it, for every item alike |
| 4 | **How much is already listed** (competition) | number of listings / quantity available vs what you post; on a pooled commodity AH (Forever uses the modern `C_AuctionHouse`, commodities per unit) only the units priced below yours matter | **not done**: Auctionator stores the quantity, we don't read it |
| 5 | **Where the server is in its life** | week 1-2: everything raw sells (crafters levelling, bags), gold is scarce so nominal prices are low but demand is total; weeks 3-8: low-level mats glut as the population passes through; month 2+: alts and inflation lift low-level mats again, vendor prices stay fixed copper so the vendor gets relatively worse forever; raid opening lifts enchanting mats, herbs, elementals | **not done** |
| 6 | **Price age** | scan daily, distrust old data | done: 7-day max age |
| 7 | **Bag space and time** | the real constraint while levelling; vendoring is "guaranteed silver now" | partly: one-press mailing removes the time cost on the main; the bank alt still pays posting time per stack |

Prior-art thresholds for reference: MuleMate mails when AH after cut >= 110% of vendor;
KeepOrSell puts an item in "AuctionHouse" at >= 2x vendor and otherwise junk, with "no
auction price means no junk". Ours (5s and 25%) sits between them.

## 3. Data we can get without the player doing anything

| Signal | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Unit price, age, exactness, disenchant | `Auctionator.API.v1` (stable, confirmed in game) | in use |
| **Quantity available** at the last scan, per day | `Auctionator.Database:GetPriceHistory(dbKey)[i].available` (Auctionator sums `available` over every listing in a full scan; `a[day]` keeps the day's max) | **not stable API** (README: "any other function may break"); `pcall` + nil checks, listed under Beta unknowns |
| **Daily price history** (up to 21 days, Auctionator default `PRICE_HISTORY_DAYS`) | same call: `minSeen` (lowest min buyout of the day), `maxSeen` (highest min buyout of the day) | same |
| dbKey for a link | `Auctionator.Utilities.BasicDBKeyFromLink(link)` = item ID as a string for everything but high-level gear | same |
| Days since launch | `GetServerTime()` (documented in Forever) minus `1793833200`; fall back to the first time Mailworthy saw this realm (`MailworthyDB.realms[realm].firstSeen`) for any later realm | new, trivial |
| Commodity or item | `C_AuctionHouse.GetItemCommodityStatus` (2 = commodity; measured) | available |

Nothing here needs the AH open, and nothing writes into Blizzard UI.

## 4. Proposed changes, ranked by impact

Impact = extra gold for a levelling player x how often it triggers, divided by
risk and code. All of them are pure `Valuation` logic plus one adapter function in
`Prices.lua`; nothing touches the controller UI.

### 4.1 HIGH: value items at a smoothed price, not the last minimum

Replace the single last-scan min buyout with the **median of the daily `maxSeen` over
the last 3 scanned days** (fall back to the API price when history is missing). Mark
the verdict "(1 scan)" when only one day exists. Why first: one 1-copper undercut
or one empty market flips a verdict today, in both directions, and this costs the
player nothing to understand. Cheap: ~30 lines plus specs.

### 4.2 HIGH: a fresh-realm default for unpriced white trade goods

In the first weeks almost nothing has a price even with Auctionator installed, and
"no price" currently means **keep for the vendor**. On a fresh realm the opposite is
right for cloth, ore, herbs, leather: they always sell. Rule: with Auctionator present
but no price, mail white (quality 1) **trade goods (class 7)** and tag them `AH` on the
bank alt, exactly like the no-Auctionator rule already does for every white item. Stop
doing it once the item has a price or after launch day 14, whichever comes first. This
is where most levelling gold is made and where our data is thinnest.

### 4.3 HIGH: a liquidity factor from supply and trend (competition)

From the history, compute per item:

```
available = quantity listed at the last scan (units)
trend     = median(maxSeen, last 3 days) / median(maxSeen, days 4-10) - 1    -- nil with < 4 days
glut      = available >= 10 x our count  and  trend <= -0.25
thin      = available == 0 or nil for 7 days with a price older than 3 days
```

Use it two ways, both invisible to the player:

- **Expected price haircut**: `glut` values the item at the 3-day `minSeen` instead of
  the median (you will be undercutting into a falling market), and counts the deposit
  as lost (relist 1.0). Everything else counts the deposit at **0.5** (refunded when it
  sells; raw materials sell). Today's 1.0 for all items is the single biggest reason
  cheap stacks of cloth fail the 5s gate.
- **Bank trigger**: `glut` on a bank-eligible item (4.4) means "mail it, don't list it".

"How many other stacks" is not available as a count; the AH is pooled per unit for
commodities on Forever, so units available is the right measure anyway.

### 4.4 MEDIUM-HIGH: the **Bank** category (operator request)

A fourth verdict next to AH / DE / V: **B**: mail it to the bank alt, but **hold it**
for a later phase where it sells higher. The main's window shows it in the Mailing list
with a "bank" chip; the bank alt sees a `B` tag, the tooltip says "Bank: expected to
sell higher after Dec 9 (raids)" and the summary gets a "Bank" line. It is still mailed
through the same safe path (unlocked, tradeable, to the saved alt, after Send).

An item is **B** when it would be mailed anyway (AH or common route) **and** one of:

1. **Phase list**: its item class / subclass is on the late-demand list and the
   server is before the phase that wants it:
   - enchanting materials (dust, essence, shard; class 7 subclass 12) before day 35
     (first raids Dec 9): everybody enchants at 60, nobody while levelling;
   - herbs from Bruiseweed up (level 20+ herbs, class 7 subclass 9) before day 35:
     raid consumables;
   - elemental drops (Elemental Earth / Fire / Water / Air, Essence of X, class 7
     subclass 10 "elemental") before day 35;
   - level 40+ ore and bars (Mithril, Truesilver, Thorium) before day 35.
   Low-level cloth, ore, leather and herbs are **not** on it: the levelling player
   needs the gold now (mount at 40), and their later recovery is slow and uncertain.
2. **Measured glut** (4.3) on any trade good whose 10-day `maxSeen` median is at least
   1.5x today's price: the market is flooded right now and was better last week.

Cap: B never applies after launch day 60 (the phase table is over; from there the
measured signal in 4.3 alone decides, and only as a haircut). Bank space on the alt is
finite, so B is selective by design; the player can still lock an item to keep it, or
the bank alt can list a B item whenever they like (tags are advice).

Cost: a phase table and list in `Valuation`, `route = "bank"` through `Bags`, `Mailer`
(no change), `MailWindow` chip, `BankAlt` tag + tooltip + summary line, `Report`.
Medium. Risk: a wrong phase list banks gold the player wanted; mitigated by the
"would be mailed anyway" precondition and the day-60 cap.

### 4.5 MEDIUM: server age as a threshold modifier

Days since launch feeds three small things, no new setting:

| Launch day | Effect |
|---|---|
| 0-13 | 4.2 fresh-realm default on; min gain stays 5s / 25% |
| 14-34 | 4.4 phase list active; glut detection has enough history to work |
| 35+ | enchanting / herb / elemental B items switch to AH; vendor gets relatively worse as gold inflates: scale `minGain` by `1 + day / 180` (5s at launch, 7s 30c at day 90) so the preview does not fill with 5s items the player no longer cares about |

Low code, medium value; mostly it keeps the preview short later on.

### 4.6 LOW: stack-count competition for gear

For non-commodity items (greens, weapons) `available` is a listing count. The DE route
already dominates for greens with Disenchantry; a listing count adds little. Skip.

### 4.7 LOW: `exact` flag

Auctionator's `IsAuctionDataExactByItemLink` is already read and unused. Apply a 10%
haircut to inexact prices in 4.1. One line, small gain.

## 5. Recommended order

1. **4.1 + 4.7** (smoothed price): one PR, pure `Valuation` + `Prices.History`.
2. **4.2** (fresh-realm default) + the `ServerDay` helper from 4.5: must ship before Nov 4.
3. **4.3** (liquidity haircut, relist factor 0.5 by default) with its specs.
4. **4.4** (Bank category) on top of 4.3 and the phase table.
5. **4.5** threshold scaling, last, after a few weeks of real data from `/mw report`.

Every PR adds its unknowns to README "Beta unknowns": `Auctionator.Database` history
being readable on Forever, `GetItemCommodityStatus` away from the AH, and the
`GetServerTime` anchor.
