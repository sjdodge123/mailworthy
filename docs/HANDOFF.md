# Mailworthy handoff (2026-10-13)

Everything a new agent needs to continue Mailworthy from this directory. It
was built in one long session that started in the LedgerLink repo; this file
replaces that conversation. Read it fully, then `docs/PLAN.md`.

## 1. What Mailworthy is

A WoW **Forever** addon (client 1.60.1, `## Interface: 16001`; classic-style game,
retail-style UI code). At a mailbox, one button mails every bag item worth more on
the auction house (after fees) or disenchanted than at a vendor to the player's
**bank alt**; the rest stays in the bags for the vendor. The bank alt then sees
tags (AH / DE / Vendor) recomputed with fresh prices. Optional integrations:
Auctionator (prices, recommended) and Siz DisenchantValue (disenchant values; switches
on the disenchant comparison; Disenchantry, now gone from CurseForge, still counts as
the switch).

The operator (repo owner) plays on a **Windows PC with a gamepad**, tests in
game, and pastes reports back. **Keyboard/mouse is the priority** ("if mouse/kb
doesn't work no one will use it"); the controller is a must-have bonus that
must never break the game.

| Sibling project | LedgerLink (CurseForge 1728299), a separate repo. Its `/rl probe` sections S5-S8 (v1.3.0-v1.3.3) were Mailworthy's first discovery tool: price addons, bag values, mail/AH/gamepad APIs, smart navigation dumps, the bag "More" menu recorder, AH deposits. LedgerLink's own rules (wire format owned by Raid Ledger) don't apply here |

**Same-named files trap:** LedgerLink also has `media/logo-400.png`,
`media/curseforge-description.html`, etc. Always use paths inside this repo.

## 3. Code (Mailworthy/, load order = .toc)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `Core.lua` | namespace, SavedVariables (`MailworthyDB` account, `MailworthyCharDB` per char), event dispatch `ns.On/ns.Fire`, slash `/mw`, **feature switches** `/mw feature <name> on|off` (mailButton, padTriangle, padNav, padLock, altClickLock, slotBorder; logged at login) |
| `Log.lua` | account-wide self-test log (400 lines) |
| `Blocked.lua` | records `ADDON_ACTION_FORBIDDEN/BLOCKED` blamed on Mailworthy, with the last command; chat line |
| `Characters.lua` | known characters (name "First Surname", realm, faction, class, level, professions); `Mailable()` = same realm+faction; SavedVariables marker per login/reload |
| `Gamepad.lua` | read-only helpers: button symbols (`labelStyle`, `CreateAtlasMarkup`), API presence |
| `Locks.lua` | **item locks** (by item ID, per character; follow the item; slot locks migrate); Alt+click via `hooksecurefunc("HandleModifiedItemClick")`; L3 via read-only `SmartNavigation:GetCurrentButton()` |
| `Border.lua` | blue glow on locked items: Blizzard's quest border texture tinted blue, on bag buttons via `hooksecurefunc(frame, "UpdateItems")` on combined + individual bag frames; shown only while a mailbox is open (`MAIL_SHOW` / `MAIL_CLOSED`, `MailFrame:IsShown()`) unless the `glowEverywhere` flag is set; a fresh lock flashes `Border.FLASH` (3 s) anywhere, via `Locks.OnChanged(itemID, locked)` |
| `MailButton.lua` | "Mailworthy" button under the mail window on both tabs (children of InboxFrame / SendMailFrame, created at login); `Activate` toggles the window; controller on the Inbox gets an "R1 first" hint (we never switch tabs) |
| `Nav.lua` | Mailworthy's **own** controller navigation for its window: nearest button within 45 degrees, top-left start, gold highlight |
| `PadKey.lua` | Mailworthy's **own override bindings** (watcher every 0.1 s, re-apply when replaced, clear on focus loss and at `PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED`): set `mail` (Triangle), `window` (Triangle, D-pad, Cross, Circle), `bags` (L3 lock) |
| `Prices.lua` | Auctionator adapter (`Lookup`: AH price per unit, age in days, exact, disenchant; nil without Auctionator), disenchant value from Siz DisenchantValue (`DisenchantValueOf`: `DisenchantValueAPI.GetValue(link)`, else Auctionator's call; `deSource`), vendor price (`GetItemInfo` 11th return), class ID, `DisenchantAddon()` / `DisenchantAddonInstalled()` (Siz DisenchantValue by its API table, Disenchantry by `DisenchantryDB`) |
| `Valuation.lua` | **pure** decision rule: settings (defaults + saved, disenchant follows the disenchant addon, `keepProfessionMats` on), profession materials (`PROFESSION_MATS` by skill line ID x trade-goods subclass, `NeededBy`, `CraftingProfessions`; `settings.professions` filled by `Bags.Evaluate` from `Characters.Professions()`), deposit, thresholds, keep reasons, no-Auctionator rule, `Money` formatting |
| `Bags.lua` | scan bags 0-5 (`LastBag()` = `NUM_TOTAL_EQUIPPED_BAG_SLOTS`: backpack, bags 1-4, reagent bag; `IsBag()` shared with Locks) -> slots -> items (grouped per link + bound + in-use), locks, prices, verdicts, totals; `/mw scan` report in the copy box (sends nothing) |
| `Config.lua` | saved settings (`MailworthyDB.settings` only what the player touched, `bankAlts[realm|faction]` set by a pick or by the bank alt itself via `SetBankAltHere`, `names` history); flags `minimapHidden`, `tagsEverywhere`, `glowEverywhere`; choices, auto-complete, steppers |
| `Widgets.lua` | window / button / label / legend helpers shared by all windows |
| `Mailer.lua` | sending: plan 12 stacks per mail, re-check each slot, attach, zero money/COD, `SendMail`, chain on `MAIL_SEND_SUCCESS`; stops on failure / close / combat / 10 s; a run id kills a stopped run's timers; records `MailworthyDB.mailed` (30 days) |
| `MailWindow.lua` | the window at the mailbox (`media/ui-prototype.png`): To, Mailing rows (chip + gain), Staying rows (reason), total, Send / Settings / Close; rows toggle item locks; pages of 8 / 5 |
| `BankAlt.lua` | bank alt view: verdicts with no postage (`Verdict`: ah / de / v), tags on bag buttons (a `Border` decorator), tooltip lines via `TooltipDataProcessor`, summary window (`/mw summary`, mail button on the bank alt); switches `bankAltTags`, `tooltipLines`; setting `tagsEverywhere` |
| `SettingsUI.lua` | settings window (bank alt buttons, "This character is my bank alt" for a second account, optional typed name with "not seen" second press, steppers, disenchant, 2/8/24h, minimap toggle); controller via `PadKey` set `settings` (works away from the mailbox) |
| `MinimapButton.lua` | LedgerLink's minimap button (click: settings; drag: move); feature `minimapButton` |
| `Report.lua` | `/mw report` (one copyable report: build, controller, switches, bank alt, settings, locks, last send, bindings, peers, blocked actions, log), the copy box `/mw scan` uses, and the AH sale-mail reader (house cut). Replaced the discovery self-test in Phase 5 |
| `Routes.lua` | **bindings** (2026-10-26): a crafting profession's materials to one player (`MailworthyDB.routes[realm\|faction]` for all the account's characters, `MailworthyCharDB.routes` for this one; this character's win). Pure `Divert(item, verdict, price, settings, routes)`: route `friend`, `to`, `what`; never over a hard keep; at or above the binding's `cap` (copper per unit, `CAP_STEPS`, 5g default, nil = none) the normal verdict stands with `capped`. `SkipOnce` per mailbox visit. `Candidates()`: party / raid units, guild via `C_Club` (`GetGuildRosterInfo` fallback), known characters, peers; `Clean` drops "-Realm". Pure `Crafter(route, peer)` / `Recipient(route)`: the bound player, or the character of theirs that has the profession (from their hello) |
| `Comms.lua` | hellos between Mailworthys (`C_ChatInfo`, prefix `Mailworthy`): `H2\|<own crafting skill lines>\|<Name=ids;...>` (the account's other crafters here) / `A2`; peers in `MailworthyDB.peers[realm\|faction]` (60 days); throttled; everything received is validated data. Switch `comms` |
| `RoutesUI.lua` | the friends window (`/mw friends`, settings button, Mailworthy window button): binding rows (cap stepper, scope, Remove; names the crafter the mail goes to), then pick a player (online first, professions suggested), then the profession |

Tests: `spec/` (busted on LuaJIT, 207 specs) with a WoW stub in
`spec/support/wow_stub.lua` (bags, mail send tab, postage, timers with delays,
override bindings, focused frame, item buttons that **error on any field write**).
`Nav` drives the most recently shown visible window (`Nav.Root`); Circle closes only that one.
Guard spec `no_gamepad_taint_spec.lua`: Mailworthy may only *read*
`FrameControlsManager:GetActiveFrame()` and `SmartNavigation:GetCurrentButton()`.

## 4. Measured facts (in game, 2026-10-13)

- Auctionator 340/341 on Forever: `Auctionator.API.v1` has `GetAuctionPriceByItemLink`,
  `GetAuctionAgeByItemLink`, `IsAuctionDataExactByItemLink`, `GetDisenchantPriceByItemLink`,
  `GetVendorPriceByItemLink`, `RegisterForDBUpdate` (caller ID "Mailworthy"). Prices only
  after a scan. Disenchant values were never seen (no green item tested).
- Disenchantry 1.1.1: no readable price data (`DisenchantryDB` = settings only). Siz
  DisenchantValue (CurseForge `siz-disenchantvalue`, Forever 1.60.1, Sep 2026) documents
  `DisenchantValueAPI.GetValue(link)` = copper or nil for other addons (Auctionator's DE
  Value column uses it); not yet seen in game (2026-10-22).
- Postage: **30c per attached item** (30c empty). 12 attachments per mail.
- AH: modern `C_AuctionHouse`; durations index 1/2/3 = **2 / 8 / 24 hours**;
  deposit = **floor(vendor value of stack x 5%) x 1 / 4 / 12**, same for commodities
  and items, computable with the AH closed (0 for uncached items).
  `GetItemCommodityStatus`: 1 = item, 2 = commodity. AH cut assumed **5%** (not yet
  verified; `GetInboxInvoiceInfo` on a sale mail gives `consignment`).
- Attaching with `C_Container.UseContainerItem` works on a press **and from a timer**;
  `ClearSendMail()` returns items; `SendMail(name, subject, "")` to "First Surname"
  works; mail 2 chained after `MAIL_SEND_SUCCESS` with no press works; mails were in
  the bank alt's inbox 89 s later.
- Bags: backpack 20 slots, `NUM_BAG_SLOTS` 4, reagent bag = bag 5 (`NUM_TOTAL_EQUIPPED_BAG_SLOTS` 5, source;
  a CurseForge user had items there that v0.5.1 ignored, 2026-10-21); `GetContainerItemInfo` gives
  `isBound, hasNoValue, isLocked, quality, stackCount, itemID, hyperlink, iconFileID`;
  quest via `GetContainerItemQuestInfo`; sell price = `GetItemInfo` 11th return.
- Settings API: `Settings.RegisterCanvasLayoutCategory` (no `InterfaceOptions_AddCategory`); not used (taint risk).
- Mail auto-complete has no "my characters" flag (own list needed).
- SavedVariables persist across login, character switch and `/reload`.
- `labelStyle` "Shapes" (PlayStation); atlas markup works. Minimap buttons are not
  reachable with the controller.
- **alpha3/alpha4/alpha5: zero blocked actions** with controller and mouse/keyboard.
  Own Triangle binding: 9 presses, Blizzard replaced it twice in 2 minutes.
- **alpha5 (all 11 questions yes):** envelope icon, Alt+click and L3 locks, locks
  follow the item through sorting, blue glow, Triangle toggles the window, D-pad
  highlight reaches every button, Cross presses, Circle closes only our window,
  bags keep their Triangle, Cross still uses items.

## 5. Pitfalls (each cost a test round)

**Taint (the big one).** Any addon write into Blizzard's gamepad UI taints gamepad
input until `/reload`; the game then blocks `SetPreferredGamepadInteractTarget`,
jumping (`DescendStop`, `RunBinding`), `InteractUnit`, `ClearTarget`, `SpellStopCasting`
and bag item use (`UNKNOWN()`). Proven unsafe:
1. Prompted bindings on Blizzard footers (`AddPromptedBinding` + `Finalize`) - alpha1, tainted at login.
2. Registering our window: `FrameControlsManager:FrameShown`, own `CreatePromptedBindingFooter` (and by source/prior art `ShowUIPanel`) - this is why **L2/R2 into our window is not possible**.
3. **`Menu.ModifyMenu("MORE_CONTEXT_ACTIONS")`** (bag item Triangle "More" menu), even unclicked - alpha2. The operator asked for it twice; the answer is L3 + Bag locks.
4. `CreateFrame` while a gamepad panel is open (SmartNavigation's CreateFrame hook runs in our context). **Create every frame at login**, on UIParent, then `SetParent`.
5. Writing any Lua field on a Blizzard frame, or any `smartNavigation*` / `OnSmartNav*` / `buttonContext` key on ours.
6. `MailFrameTab_OnClick` from addon code (writes `MailFrame.activeSubFrame`, read by focus code): **never switch mail tabs ourselves**.
7. `SetFocus` from addon code (LedgerLink: blocked `SetPreferredGamepadInteractTarget`, client crash). The player clicks edit boxes.

Safe (verified or source-backed): own override bindings on our own frame
(`SetOverrideBindingClick(ourFrame, true, key, ourButton)`; gamepad modules don't
listen to `UPDATE_BINDINGS`); `hooksecurefunc` post-hooks; textures / font strings
on Blizzard frames kept in our own weak tables; read-only `GetActiveFrame`,
`GetCurrentButton`, `InputUtil.IsGamepadUIEnabled`; mail API calls from timers;
tooltip lines (Auctionator adds them, never blamed).

**Unsolved:** plain buttons under `SendMailFrame` should be in smart navigation's
"Send Mail" group (`Utility.FindButtonGroups` walks all descendants, no bounds
check), but the D-pad never reached them in alpha3/alpha4. Hence `Nav` + `PadKey`.
Blizzard ships `SmartNavigationDebug` (overlay of navigable buttons) if this needs
revisiting; showing it needs `/run`, which the operator shouldn't be asked to do lightly.

**Timers outliving their run.** A `C_Timer.After` callback queued by a send run still
fires after that run stops (combat, mailbox closed): the first Mailer draft would then
call `SendMail` anyway. Every Mailer timer checks the run id and `busy`.

**Process pitfalls.**
- The operator **merges PRs silently**. Before pushing to a PR branch, gate the push
  on `gh pr view N --json state --jq .state` == OPEN (a printed check in the same
  script is not enough: PR #6 lost two commits that way, recovered in PR #7).
- zsh doesn't word-split `$(...)` in `for` loops; pass commit lists explicitly.
- Code run from `OnUpdate` / events is wrapped in `pcall` and only *logs* errors, so a
  spec passes while the code errors every tick (alpha5: `PadKey.Check` on `pairs(nil)`
  ten times a second flooded the 400-line log). Specs for such code assert the log
  has no error lines (`spec/padkey_spec.lua` `after_each`).
- The stub's `GetCenter`, `IsVisible` and parent tracking matter for `Nav` specs.
- Reports come back as one .txt with several reports (main + bank alt); read them all.
- Ask for in-game tests only when the source research says the fix is real; the
  operator wants few iterations.

## 6. Decisions

- Keyboard/mouse first; controller everywhere too; no mouse-only gestures, no
  required typing; `SetFocus` never.
- Locks are **per item ID** (all stacks, follow moves), per character; Alt+click
  (mouse), L3 in bags (controller), Bag locks page; blue quest-style glow.
  **No never-mail list** (operator, 2026-10-13: locks cover it).
- After a send, the main's bags get **V** tags (vendor items, grey junk) for the session;
  locks re-evaluate tags at once (operator, 2026-10-14). `BankAlt.Mode()` = "vendor".
- Settings: our own window, not Blizzard's options panel (registering there hands our
  tables to a controller-navigated panel; same taint pattern as the More menu).
  Valuation defaults apply until the player touches a setting.
- Mailbox entry: "Mailworthy" button under the mail window (both tabs); controller:
  R1 then Triangle; Mailworthy's own D-pad / Cross / Circle while its window is
  open; no L2/R2 cycling into it; no More-menu entry.
- Decision rule (PLAN): AH net = price x count x 0.95 - deposit - 30c postage vs
  vendor; deposit for the **24h listing** (operator, 2026-10-13) = floor(vendor x
  count x 5%) x 12, half counted (relist factor 0.5 since 2026-10-20; a glut counts it in full);
  mail when gain >= **5s and 25%** (defaults, steppers in settings);
  disenchant compared when enabled (default on if Siz DisenchantValue or Disenchantry is
  installed; the value from Siz DisenchantValue, else Auctionator, since 2026-10-22).
  **Without Auctionator: mail every unlocked, tradeable white (common) item**;
  greys and uncommon+ stay. Soulbound / quest items can't be mailed (don't list them).
- Decision rule v2 (operator, 2026-10-20: "most gold while levelling, no math for the
  player"; built from ALGORITHM-RESEARCH.md steps 1-5): the price is the 3-day median of
  Auctionator's history (its database, not the stable API: guarded); launch day from
  `GetServerTime()` against Nov 4, 2026 (`Valuation.LAUNCH_EPOCH`), or the realm's first
  sight when earlier; days 0-13 mail unpriced white trade goods; a glut (10x our count
  listed, -25%) is valued at the floor; **Bank** verdict (B tag) for late-demand trade
  goods before day 35 and gluts until day 60; the minimum gain grows 1/180 a day after
  day 35, capped at 2x. No new settings.
- Bank alt picked from known characters (same realm + faction), never typed by default.
- **Bank alt on a second WoW account** (Reddit r/wowaddons, 2026-10-24): SavedVariables are
  per account, so the main's pick never reaches the alt. The alt declares itself with the
  settings button "This character is my bank alt" (`Config.SetBankAltHere`, `ClearBankAlt`,
  `IsBankAltHere`); it writes the **same** `bankAlts[realm|faction]` slot a pick uses (one
  bank alt per realm + faction per account, so the account's other characters mail to it),
  and `BankAlt.IsBankAlt()` reads it. The typed path still refuses the character's own name
  and points at the button. Not crossing accounts: price scans (Auctionator per account) and
  the "Mailed for" history (`MailworthyDB.mailed`, written by the sender); the tooltip and
  summary skip the line when there's no record. The history is not carried in the mail
  body or subject (decided against in that PR).
- Bank alt view: AH / DE / V tags on bag slots recomputed with the bank alt's own
  prices; tooltip shows fresh verdict + "Mailed for: ..." (recorded at send time,
  `MailworthyDB.mailed`, 30-day expiry); summary window.
- Releases: **every tag publishes to CurseForge** (project **1743661**, `CF_API_KEY`
  set, `.toc` has the ID). Operator asked for plain release tags `vX.Y.Z` going
  forward; alpha tags upload as alpha files (v0.1.0-alpha5 did). **Check `git ls-remote
  --tags origin` for the latest tag before tagging** (the operator asked for "v0.6.0" on
  2026-10-21 when v0.8.0 already existed; v0.9.0 was agreed instead). Tag only when the
  operator says "tag X"; then watch the release run and report the CurseForge "Success!"
  line: the packager's later "Uploading ...zip... Success!" lines are the GitHub release,
  not CurseForge, and the run can fail after them.
- CurseForge feedback (user cursebandit, 2026-10-21, built the same day): every equipped bag
  is scanned, lockable and mailed (bags 0-5: the reagent bag was missing); the lock glow
  shows only while a mailbox is open, with a settings button ("Locked items glow blue:
  at the mailbox only / always", flag `glowEverywhere`) for the old behaviour; a new lock
  (Alt+click, L3) still glows 3 s away from a mailbox so the player sees it worked.
- Profession materials (operator, 2026-10-22: "factor in the player's own professions"): a
  setting, on by default ("Keep my professions' materials", `keepProfessionMats`), keeps trade
  goods the character's crafting professions use, as the keep reason "your Tailoring needs
  it", before any pricing. Mapping by `GetProfessionInfo` skill line ID and item subclass
  (`Valuation.PROFESSION_MATS`); gathering professions need nothing; elementals stay mailable.
- Optional deps: `.pkgmeta` `optional-dependencies` (auctionator only: the Disenchantry
  CurseForge project disappeared after v0.7.0 and its slug made v0.8.0 and v0.9.0 fail to
  upload, error 1018, fixed 2026-10-22) and `## OptionalDeps: Auctionator, Disenchantry`.

- Bindings (operator, 2026-10-26: "send my enchanting mats to a guild member and bind that,
  until cancelled; easy to X on each send and to remove; few settings; an insane market high
  still goes to my alt"): `Routes.lua` / `RoutesUI.lua` / `Comms.lua`, PLAN "Bindings". Chosen:
  the cap is a per-unit price stepper on the binding row (5g default), not a slider (numbers
  use steppers, controller rule); a binding beats the "keep my professions' materials" default;
  the bank alt's tags ignore bindings; delivery follows the profession (operator, same day:
  "get the materials to the friend that actually has the profession rather than their alt for
  the AH"): hellos carry every character's crafting professions, `Routes.Crafter` picks the
  bound player or the character of theirs that has the profession, and the "To their alt"
  toggle of the first draft is gone; the real recipient is always shown. Default scope: all
  the account's characters on the realm + faction. Not built: a slider widget, a never-mail
  list, typed names in the friends window (candidates only).

## 7. State right now

- alpha5's in-game check passed (DISCOVERY-SESSION-2.md "Results of the alpha5 run");
  the one bug it showed (`PadKey.Check` erroring while idle) is fixed in v0.2.0.
- Tags so far: v0.2.0 (Phase 1), v0.3.0 (settings), v0.4.0 (sending), v0.5.0 (bank alt
  view), v0.5.1 (window refreshes after sending), v0.6.0, v0.7.0 (2026-10-14), v0.8.0
  (decision rule v2, 2026-10-20), v0.9.0 (CurseForge feedback: reagent bag, mailbox-only
  glow, 2026-10-22). **CurseForge has v0.7.0 as its latest file**: v0.8.0 and v0.9.0 failed
  there on the dead `disenchantry` relation; the next tag after the fix carries both.
- Confirmed in game: the `/mw scan` math (v0.2.0, by hand), settings with mouse and
  controller and after `/reload`, one-press sending with no money / COD, the window
  lists, row locks, minimap button (v0.4.0; operator 2026-10-14).
- Phase 5 (release clean-up) built: the self-test is gone, `/mw report` replaces it.
  Pending: the Phase 4c check and a v1.0 spot check on one build
  (DISCOVERY-SESSION-2.md "v1.0 check"), then tag `v1.0.0` when the operator says so.
- Still open: AH cut (needs a sale mail; the invoice reader in `Report.lua` logs it),
  disenchant prices for green items (now from Siz DisenchantValue: see it in game),
  ForeverMail compatibility (replaces the mailbox window).

## 8. What's left (in order)

1. Phases 1-5 are built (see PLAN "Phases" and the module table above).
2. **Run the v1.0 check** with the operator (DISCOVERY-SESSION-2.md "v1.0 check"); fix
   what fails in its own PR first.
3. **Tag `v1.0.0`** when the operator says so.
4. In-game check of the 2026-10-21 feedback build: a white item in the reagent bag shows in
   `/mw scan` and the window and gets mailed; Alt+click / L3 lock it; the lock glow is gone
   away from the mailbox except a 3 s flash on a new lock, back at one, and the settings
   button turns it on everywhere.
5. After 1.0: an in-game check of decision rule v2 (`/mw scan` after an Auctionator scan: the
   "(3-day median ...)" and "market: ..." workings, "launch day N", a B item on the bank alt);
   a tailor's cloth (or any crafter's material) shown as "KEEP ... your Tailoring needs it" in
   `/mw scan` and the window, and mailed again with the setting off;
   the AH cut from a sale mail (`[invoice]` lines in `/mw report`), a green item's DE verdict
   with Siz DisenchantValue installed (`/mw scan` "disenchant Xc each" against its tooltip,
   `/mw report` "Siz DisenchantValue installed"), ForeverMail compatibility.
6. README "Beta unknowns" table and PLAN's "Still open" list kept current after each report.
7. In-game check of bindings (2026-10-26): `/mw friends` lists guild members with "online" and
   professions (C_Club on Forever) and party members; a binding's materials show "to <first
   name>" in the window and arrive with subject "Mailworthy 1/1: Enchanting materials";
   Skip once / Remove; two Mailworthy users see each other in `/mw report` ("mailworthy peer"
   with their other crafters) and a binding for a profession only an alt of theirs has shows
   "delivered to their ... character" and arrives there.
