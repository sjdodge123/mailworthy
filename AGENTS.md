# Mailworthy agent rules

Mailworthy is a WoW Forever addon (`## Interface: 16001`). Start with
`docs/HANDOFF.md` (state, decisions, pitfalls, what's left), then `docs/PLAN.md`
(design) and `docs/FOREVER-UI-NOTES.md` (Blizzard source findings, taint rules).

## Safety (STRICT)

- Mail goes **only** to the saved bank alt shown in the preview, and only after
  the player presses Send. Never attach money. Never mail a locked item.
- Re-check each slot right before attaching it; skip anything that changed.
- Without Auctionator, the only items mailed are unlocked, tradeable white
  (common) items; with Auctionator, an item without a price stays in the bags.

## Never write into Blizzard's controller UI (STRICT)

Every one of these tainted gamepad input in game (jumping, targeting, item use
blocked until /reload):

- no prompted bindings on Blizzard footers, no `GamepadSharedUtility` footers of
  our own, no `FrameControlsManager` registration, no `ShowUIPanel` for our frames;
- no entries in the gamepad "More" menu (`Menu.ModifyMenu("MORE_CONTEXT_ACTIONS")`);
- no Lua fields written on Blizzard frames, no `smartNavigation*` / `OnSmartNav*` /
  `buttonContext` keys on ours;
- no `CreateFrame` while a gamepad panel is open: create every frame at login
  (on UIParent, then `SetParent`);
- never switch mail tabs from addon code (`MailFrameTab_OnClick`);
- **never call `SetFocus`** (it crashed the gamepad UI in LedgerLink).

Allowed: our own override bindings on our own frame (`PadKey.lua`, out of combat,
cleared on focus loss and at `PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED`), `hooksecurefunc` post-hooks,
textures / font strings on Blizzard frames kept in our own tables, read-only
`FrameControlsManager:GetActiveFrame()` / `SmartNavigation:GetCurrentButton()`.
`spec/no_gamepad_taint_spec.lua` guards this; keep it passing.

## Input (STRICT)

- **Keyboard/mouse first**, controller too: every feature works with both.
- Controller navigation in our windows goes through `Nav.lua` + `PadKey.lua`
  (Mailworthy's own highlight and bindings), not Blizzard's smart navigation.
- No right-click-only, modifier-only (Alt+click has the controller's L3 twin),
  drag or hover-only actions; no required typing.
- Every piece that touches Blizzard UI has a `/mw feature` switch.

## Working rules

- Branches and PRs only; never push to `main`, never force-push.
- The operator merges PRs without saying so: gate every push to a PR branch on
  `gh pr view N --json state --jq .state` being `OPEN`; if merged, branch from
  `origin/main` and open a new PR.
- Tag only when the operator says so ("tag vX.Y.Z"). Every tag publishes to
  CurseForge (project 1743661); plain `vX.Y.Z` = release file. Watch the release run
  and report the CurseForge upload line.
- Never invent WoW API functions: read Blizzard's Forever source
  (Ketho/wow-ui-source-forever) first; wrap anything unverified in `pcall` / nil
  checks and list it under "Beta unknowns" in README.md.
- In-game checks go into one copyable report (`/mw report`), not
  lists of `/dump` lines. Ask for an in-game test only when research shows the fix
  is real.
- Mailworthy files share names with LedgerLink's (`media/logo-400.png`, ...): link
  them by full path in messages.
- Before every push: `eval "$(luarocks --lua-version=5.1 path)"`, then
  `busted --lua=luajit` and `luacheck .`.
