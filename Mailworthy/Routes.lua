-- Bindings: "send my Enchanting materials to Bob" (operator, 2026-10-26). A binding
-- ties one crafting profession to one player (a guild member, a party member or
-- one of the player's own characters): every trade good that profession uses
-- (Valuation.PROFESSION_MATS) is mailed to that player instead of being valued
-- for the auction house, until the binding is removed. Saved for all the
-- account's characters on this realm + faction (MailworthyDB.routes) or for this
-- character only (MailworthyCharDB.routes); this character's bindings win.
--
-- A profession binding also takes its profession's recipes (item class 9, Valuation.RecipeProfession;
-- operator, 2026-11-08: "recipes should go to their respective profession mappings"), cap included.
--
-- Safety: locks, soulbound / quest / in-use items and profession tools still
-- stay; a binding never mails what the normal rule wouldn't touch. The price
-- cap ("to my alt at 10s each or more", a stepper on the binding) keeps a material
-- the market suddenly wants: at or above the cap the normal rule applies and
-- the item goes to the bank alt. "Skip once" drops a binding for this mailbox
-- visit (cleared at MAIL_CLOSED). The recipient is always shown in the window.
-- When the bound player runs Mailworthy, its hello (Comms) lists their
-- characters' crafting professions, and the mail goes to the one that has the
-- bound profession: the player themself when they do, their crafter when they
-- don't, the player when nothing is known (operator, 2026-10-26: the goal is
-- the friend who actually has the profession, never their alt for the AH).
--
-- A class binding (operator, 2026-11-08: "this is a mage only item, id like to be able to friend
-- mail these types of items too"): { to, class = "MAGE" } instead of a profession. It takes
-- items only that class may use (the tooltip's "Classes: Mage", Classes.lua) and this character
-- can't, with the same hard keeps and price cap; the mail goes to the player named.
--
-- Who can be bound: the party / raid (unit tokens), the guild (C_Club member
-- info, which carries each member's two professions and presence, as Blizzard's
-- Communities roster reads it on Forever; GetGuildRosterInfo as the fallback),
-- the account's known characters, and whoever Comms heard from. Every game call
-- is guarded; a missing API just means a shorter list.
