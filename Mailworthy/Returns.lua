-- Return to sender (operator, 2026-11-08: "a button that just allows me to 'queue up' a return
-- to sender list. it should be a toggle ... everything that was mailed to you by someone gets put
-- on the same list we use for regular mailworthy evaluations to mail back to them ... available
-- to everyone, not just bank alts. clicking it again returns it to normal mode").
--
-- A toggle on the Mailworthy window, for this mailbox visit (off again at MAIL_CLOSED, like Skip
-- once). While it is on, what another character mailed this one goes back to them, on the same
-- Mailing list as everything else, shown with its recipient before Send and sent only by Send.
--
-- Who mailed what comes from the mail ledger (Ledger.lua): every item this character took out
-- of the mailbox, with its sender. Counted per sender and item: what was received from them,
-- less what this character has mailed them since (a return already made, a gift back). Not
-- counted: system mail (the auction house, GMs), COD mail (a purchase), returned mail (our own
-- items coming back). Several senders of one item: the latest first. Whole stacks only (the
-- mailer never splits a stack): a stack bigger than what is still owed stays and follows the
-- normal rule. Hard keeps (locked, soulbound, quest, conjured, in use, a profession tool) never go.
-- Switch: /mw feature returnToSender off (no button).
